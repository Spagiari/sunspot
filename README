#sunspot

Introduction
============

This is the implementation of a modified and expanded version for the sunspot
detection algorithm described in the article "Automatic Sunspots Detection on
Full-DiskSolar Images using Mathematical Morphology", written by J.J. Curto,
M. Blanca and E. MartÃ­nez. Images from SOHO observatory were used in the tests
and results.

We also generated an article about our changes and it is currently under
revision. We will make it available as soon as it is ready.

Building
========

Our software build tool is cmake, you also need OpenCV to build this code.
If you run a debian based machine, you can install the dependecies typing
this on command line:

> sudo apt-get install gcc g++ cmake make libcv-dev libhighgui-dev cfitsio

After that, enter in the build subdirectory and type:

> cd build
> cmake ..
> make

That's it... Have fun! :)
